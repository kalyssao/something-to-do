# something-to-do
A Firefox extension to keep my tasks close at hand when I get stuck in the infinite loop of procrastination.

Practice project sourced heavily from "How to make a to-do list" from W3 schools, found here: 
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp

This was an attempt at getting my feet wet with HTML/CSS/JS. I definitely liked the results!
